At the beginning of the app you are promp with a question asking if you are ready for the hangman. If you type yes or hit enter you'll be given a random word represented by undercores,  and will be asked to enter a letter. If the letter that you enter matches the hidden word then that letter will be revealed from the word. If your letter doesn't match any of the letters in the word your guesses count will go down by one. If you guess all the word your wins will go up.
